I'm a 25yo Cybersecurity student in my final year at UGR, soon to graduate as a Cybersecurity Technician while continuing my Bachelor's degree. I also have a background in Full Stack Development from Digital House, with experience in Python, Java, JavaScript, React, and MySQL. My work is guided by industry frameworks like ISO 27001, NIST, and OWASP.
With over 5 years of experience in small teams across legal and real estate sectors, I bring a strong interdisciplinary mindset to tech. I'm passionate about building secure, efficient solutions and continuously improving through hands-on projects and collaboration.
